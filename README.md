##Handmade Hero Swift Cocoa Platform Layer

This is an ongoing OS X port of Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero.

The goal is to be able to drop in Casey's platform independent game source code and compile and run it unchanged.

####IMPORTANT

I removed Casey's platform-independent game code from this repository. At the moment that is just handmade.cpp and handmade.h.

Once you clone or update from this repository, copy over the handmade.cpp/.h files from Casey's source code into the handmadeSrc folder.

This repository works with Casey's handmade.cpp/.h files from handmade_hero_025_source.
